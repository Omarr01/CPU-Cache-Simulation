# CPU-Cache-Simulation
A successful implementation of a simplified CPU cache system that works by retrieving data (from cache if possible, otherwise from memory) given the memory addresses of the data and successfully updating the cache upon the data retrieval. One time using prolog and the other using haskell.
## 3 Types of Cache Mapping Techniques: 
- Direct Mapping
- Fully Associative
- Set Associative
## Technologies
- Prolog
- Haskell
